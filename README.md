# adoc-cv
This project embeds my CV with AsciiDoc files. Using asciidoc-pdf helps to me bundle it as a PDF file.

## Prerequisites

Install Ruby
```
apt-get install ruby
ruby --version
```

## Getting Started

Asciidoctor PDF is published to RubyGems.org as a pre-release. 
Since itâ€™s in pre-release, you have to specify the --pre flag when installing using the gem command.

### Install the Published Gem
```
gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre
```

Check with 
```
gem which asciidoctor-pdf
```
